# Arbitrary Style transfer using DenseNet with Adaptive Instance Normalization 

**Motivation** 
- Artistic Rendering 
- New visualization of ideas for data despite of any preconceived messages 
- To generate abstract textures without restricting it to any predefined set of styles

**What is Arbitrary Style Transfer?**
- Arbitrary style transfer aims to synthesize a content image with the style of an image to create a third image that has never been seen before.
